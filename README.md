# Minesweeper-Autosolver

A minesweeper autosolver bot that is mostly basing on the openCV-python directory as a detection engine. I have decided to create it to master my game botting and algorithmic thinking skills, so you can consider this an important part of my portfolio.
It's a very easy to use, interactive Command-line interface that uses user input for navigation. 
It is most recommended that you use the [Windows XP version of the game](https://minesweepergame.com/download/windows-xp-minesweeper.php) as the primary version of this program has been made for this client.
